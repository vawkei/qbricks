  VITE v7.3.1  ready in 2235 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```

# Installan of some frontend Packages:  

So for me to work, I will need some packages or should i say dependencies. tio

I installed these; react-query, sass and react-router-dom:
```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-query react-router-dom sass
```

# Changing of Ports
I changed the port in which the frontend will be running on from:

```bash
http://localhost:5173/
```
to:
```bash
http://localhost:3000/
```
in the vite.config.ts file:
```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server:{
    port:3000
  }
})
```
So if i run:
```bash
 npm run dev
```
I get this in the terminal:
```bash
  VITE v7.3.1  ready in 422 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```

# The about section:
# SECTION: The Problem with Exam Preparation Today
**1️⃣ “Most exam prep tools focus on content dumps and not true assessments”**
**What it means:**
Many platforms just upload notes, PDFs, or video lessons. They prioritize content delivery, not performance testing.

**Investor explanation:**
Most edtech products are content-first (watch, read, consume). But exams measure performance under pressure. QBricks is assessment-first — we simulate the actual evaluation environment.

**2️⃣ “Students practice without understanding why answers are wrong”**
**What it means:**
Students often see a score, but don’t get structured feedback explaining their mistakes clearly.
**Investor explanation:**
Feedback quality is low in traditional prep tools. Either they show only correct answers, or explanations are generic. QBricks integrates AI to provide targeted correction logic per mistake.

**3️⃣ “Exams test performance, but prep tools rarely simulate performance”**
**What it means:**
Exams measure:
Speed
Accuracy
Time pressure
Decision-making

Most tools don’t replicate that environment realistically.

**Investor explanation:**
We focus on performance simulation, not just learning material. That includes timed questions, structured flow, and post-test analytics. We train students to perform — not just consume.

# SECTION: How QBricks is Different
**1️⃣ “Start with real exam-style questions”**
**What it means:**
Instead of teaching theory first, we start with actual past-question structure.

**Investor explanation:**
We reverse the traditional learning order. Instead of “learn → then test,” we go “test → then diagnose → then correct.” This aligns with how exams actually work.

**2️⃣ “Use AI to explain mistakes clearly”**
**What it means:**
AI doesn’t replace teachers. It explains why an answer is wrong and why another is correct — immediately and personally.

**Investor explanation:**
The differentiation isn’t just AI usage. It’s AI-driven mistake diagnosis per student attempt, enabling scalable individualized correction.

**3️⃣ “Measure performance, not just lesson completion”**
**What it means:**
We don’t track:
- Videos watched
- Notes completed

We track:
- Score

- Topic weaknesses

- Accuracy per section

- Improvement over time

**Investor explanation:**
Engagement metrics are vanity. Performance metrics are outcome-based. QBricks optimizes for exam results, not platform activity.

**4️⃣ “Exams test performance. QBricks simulates performance.”**
**What it means:**
We are building an environment that mirrors the real exam experience.

**Investor explanation:**
Simulation reduces exam anxiety and improves readiness. We position ourselves closer to exam-condition rehearsal than traditional e-learning.


# SECTION: What QBricks Offers Right Now
**1️⃣ “JAMB Styled past questions practice”**
**What it means:**
We’re starting with JAMB-like question sets and structure.

**Investor explanation:**
We are launching with a focused market (JAMB candidates) instead of a broad, diluted offering. Narrow beachhead strategy.

**2️⃣ “AI powered explanations”**
**What it means:**
After test attempts, AI provides structured correction and explanation.

**Investor explanation:**
AI scales personalized feedback without requiring human tutors, improving margins and accessibility.

**3️⃣ “Early stage classroom”**
**What it means:**
Phase 2 exists as a guided AI-based understanding layer, but it’s still evolving.

Investor explanation:
We are building progressively:
Phase 1 = Assessment engine
Phase 2 = AI understanding layer


1. “Measure performance, not just lesson completion.”
Meaning: QBricks focuses on how well a student can actually answer exam questions — not just whether they finished reading content.

2. “Exams test performance. QBricks simulates performance.”
Meaning: Real exams measure how you perform under pressure.
QBricks is designed to simulate that exact performance environment before the real exam.
